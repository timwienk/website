Personal website: Tim.Wienk.name
================================

This repository contains the "source" of my personal website, built on
top of [Pelican][]. This "source" consists of:

- Pelican configuration
- Pelican and Markdown plugins (some of which from
  [getpelican/pelican-plugins][])
- Theme files and templates
- Content files

Assuming Pelican and Markdown are installed in the (v)environment, just
running `run` should create an `output` directory with all files
necessary to serve the website.
