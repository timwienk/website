The basics
==========

My name is Tim Wienk, you've probably gathered that much already. I was
born in 1989 in Twente, the Netherlands. I'm a software developer,
project/tech manager, systems administrator, consultant, friend, beer
drinker, football watcher and (most of all) nerd focussed mainly on
subjects web and internet related.


Computer related interests
==========================

Mostly thanks to my dad I've worked and played with computers ever since
I was little. There's a Commodore 64 at my parents' place somewhere, and
a number 80286s, 80386s and 80486s used to be there but have been
decommissioned. When I was ten years old, I gave a presentation in
primary school titled "The Computer". I took all separate components of
an old 80286 computer to school, explained about the computer in
general, explained about the different components and plugged them all
on the motherboard. At the end of the presentation I triumphantly
pressed the power button and it booted Microsoft Windows 3.11
successfully. Mission accomplished!

Computers, software and technology in general became an increasingly
large part of my interests and leisure time activities, and I'm very
happy that I've been able to turn my professional career in that same
direction. However, I've never managed to actually create a website for
myself I was happy with for an extended period of time, so my current
aim is to try my hardest to stay happy with this one.


Work and projects
=================

Near the end of my time in high school I got in contact with a web
developing company, and it wasn't long until I was offered a job there.
I started off as a part time front-end developer, but when I started
working full time responsibilities grew pretty fast. I had the chance to
dive deeper into the used software and hardware and ended up doing
front- and back-end software development, technical design and
server/systems administration.

During this period I also got acquainted with an amazing group of
JavaScript enthusiasts, they called themselves [MooTools][] and aimed to
make the JavaScript world a better place. I started helping out and
became part of their team, I'm very happy with what we helped make
happen in the less popular days of JavaScript. MooTools has gotten more
silent now the need for its Core library has mostly disappeared due to
improvements to JavaScript itself, and our job has mostly been to
maintain what is there for people who still use it in existing projects.

After a number of years with the company, my role shifted more towards
project management. Later on my role shifted further towards managing
and leading the technical team of the company as a whole, with as main
goal to design and implement the direction and path for the future, both
for projects and the company's technical approach in general. All of
this, while still trying to keep space and time to do some actual
development myself.

Other projects I've worked on or helped out with can be found on the
[projects part][] of this website or on GitHub, as far as they can be
publicly shared. For an overview of my skills and expertises, both my
LinkedIn page and [my CV][] should be a good reference.
