My name is Tim Wienk. I create software on the web, from concept to development to maintenance. This website is a place where I show and tell a bit about who I am and what I do, and where I share opinions, facts and experiences about things that interest me. The first fact I'll share with you is that I'm not a very competent graphic designer, you'll have to excuse the limited aesthetic properties of this website. More about me at [About me][].
